\section{Roughness}
We refer to surface irregularities as surface \green{roughness}. Surface irregularities can have several other names, depending
 on the PBR workflow:\\ \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item roughness
\item smoothness
\item glossiness
\item micro-surface
\end{enumerate}
\\ \\All these terms describe the same aspect of a surface, which is sub-texel geometric detail.
\\ \\
These surface irregularities are authored in the roughness or glossiness map depending on the workflow that is being used. 
A physically-based BRDF is based on the \green{microfacet} theory, which supposes that a surface is composed of small-scaled planar detail surfaces of varying orientation called microfacets. 
\\ \\
Each of these small planes reflects light in a single direction based on its normal.

In the early days of game programming, all triangles in a game were considered to
 be flat, with a single normal defining the light effect on this triangle.

However, with PBR we try to model the microscopic properties of a material to create a more realistic
 lighting effect.

Each microfacet has its own normal that is taken into account in the PBR workflow. These normal do \green{not} come
 from a normal map (which would be too heavy) but are modeled as probabilistic densities (see later).
