\chapter{Absorption and scattering}
\section{Conservation of energy}
When traveling in an inhomogeneous medium or translucent material, light can be \green{absorbed} or \green{scattered}.\\
\\
\green{Absorption} of light: the energy of the photons is used to heat up the material. A non visible example is
 infrared light which can be used to warm up human skin.
\\ \\
When light is \green{scattered}, the ray direction changes randomly, and the amount of deviation depends on the material. Scattering randomizes light direction, but doesnâ€™t change its \green{intensity}.

We can now take a look at what happens when a ray hits an object (solid or liquid):
\begin{picture}
\width{640}
\begin{part}
\begin{text}
We start with a single ray that hits the surface at point {$sp}. You can think of this ray
 as a collection of photons that hits the surface at this exact point.
\end{text}
\include{r,ln,lp,sp,s,sa1,sa2,sa3,sa4,sa5,sa6,sa7,sa8,sa9}
\end{part}

\begin{part}
\begin{text}
The simplest part is the reflections of this ray directly out of the material.
\end{text}
\include{rl1,rl2,rl3}
\end{part}

\begin{part}
\begin{text}
Some of the photons in this ray will be refracted into the material.
\end{text}
\include{rl4,rl5,rl6}
\end{part}

\begin{part}
\begin{text}
Some of the photons that are refracted will be further scattered \b{inside} the material.
\end{text}
\include{ss1,ss2,ss3,ss4,ss5,ss6,ss7}
\end{part}

\begin{part}
\begin{text}
And finally, some of the photons that are refracted will be further scattered \b{outside} of the material.
\end{text}
