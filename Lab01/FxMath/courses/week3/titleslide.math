\chapter{Physically Based Rendering}

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is an umbrella term to describe techniques for
 games (and renderings) that render a scene in a more physically accurate way.\\
\\
The result looks more photorealistic than simpler algorithms, but it also ensures
 that for example the intensity of lights in the scene can be changed without creating
 visual glitches.
